# CQL ('C++ Query Language" a play on SQL)

A template for a project I had in mind where I recreate SQL in C++ for fun and to learn more about data management.
I still have plans to work on this project, likely after my [logicgate-rootkit](https://github.com/provrb/logicgate-rootkit) project is completed.
